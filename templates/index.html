                  defined as understanding emotions of others;
                  and political skills, defined as understanding people and being able to influence them in ways that c
                  ontribute to personal,
                  group or organizational success.
                  Out of the three, political skill was the only skill to have an independent positive relationship
                  with transformational leaders and their job satisfaction.

             <p class="para1"> I volunteered  at one of the homeless shelters operated by the charity Crisis over Christmas. It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made, and I’ll be doing the same next year.
                 Crisis shelters welcomed 3,600 vulnerable guests  into a safe place with a roof. They received three hot meals a day, a bed, haircuts, dental check-ups, new clothes, showers, and access to the internet – some reconnected with family members after years of silence. They could speak to Samaritans, Alcoholics Anonymous, immigration experts, housing advisors, and receive help in building a CV. They were in a safe environment without being judged.
                 This can’t happen without volunteers.

         <p class="para1"> Some people need extra care or support - practical or emotional -
             to lead an active life and do the everyday things that many of us take for granted.
             I m working to provide a social care system that provides care for those who need it,
             and which enables people to retain their independence and dignity.
